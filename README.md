Useful stuff (for myself basically):

https://github.com/PaulCombal/SamRewritten - Steam achievemnt manager and also can be used as idler for Steam games on Linux. Very easy to use on one machine to idle and play games simultaneously, without any logouts and session conflicts. Works like a charm on Manjaro and smooth installation on pamac. Use with command: 
    $ steamwritten -i 123456
    
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts - best siteblock for any platform. Works best with NetGuard on Android [https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard].
